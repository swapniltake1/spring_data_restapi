# spring_data_restapi

Spring Data Rest is a powerful framework that simplifies the creation of RESTful APIs for your Spring Data repositories. It seamlessly exposes repository interfaces as RESTful endpoints, reducing the need for boilerplate code. By automatically generating CRUD operations, query endpoints, and hypermedia-driven responses, Spring Data Rest accelerates API development while maintaining HATEOAS principles. It supports a variety of data stores and formats, enabling rapid creation of REST APIs for your GitHub repositories.
